# Tiny Python
Base on Python2.7.16

# Why?
I like python, but dont like indent/dedent for code block package. 
In fact, some cases, indent makes a mass.., 
so modify the grammar a little.

# Difference
Code Block lies between '{' '}' as well as c/c++ language.

Python:
  
    if True:
      print "If True"
      
Tiny Python:

    if True
    {
      print "If True";
    }
